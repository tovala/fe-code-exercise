# fe-code-exercise
Code challenge for FE engineers.

## Description:
Create a single-page react application that interacts with the github public API and displays the pull requests from this repo (https://github.com/tovala/fe-code-exercise) in a list. Each pull request should show the following info:

- Title
- Date Opened
- Labels
- Link to view the pull request

### The app should also contain
- a loading state for the API request
- The ability to filter the pull requests by label.
- Tests if necessary.

## Rules
- Use react + any libraries you would like
- Document code in your README.md
- Have fun! The whole point of this exercise is for you to showcase the way you code and start a conversation with us. Feel free to go above and beyond the requirements ;)
