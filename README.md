# fe-code-exercise
Code challenge for FE engineers.

## Description:
Create a single-page react application that interacts with the github public API and displays the pull requests from this repo (https://github.com/tovala/fe-code-exercise) in a list. Each pull request should show the following info:

- Title
- Date Opened
- Labels
- Link to view the pull request

### The app should also contain
- a loading state for the API request
- The ability to filter the pull requests by label.
- Tests if necessary.

## Guidelines
- Use react + any libraries you would like
- Document code in your README.md
- Have fun! The whole point of this exercise is for you to showcase the way you code and start a conversation with us. Feel free to go above and beyond the requirements ;) 

## What we look for
- *Coding style.* We will evaluate your solution in order to judge your programming style and level of competency. Solutions need not be perfect, "production-ready", or even bug-free. However, you should be able to discuss the decisions you made; if you make a conscious decision to exclude something you would normally want in a production-ready solution, or if you include a shortcut in the interest of time, be ready to talk about what you would do to to address these shortcomings and/or what you would change before you would consider something complete and ready for production.
- *Extensible design.* You will be asked if, and how, you might modify your solution to meet various hypothetical requirements including scalability, additional features, observability, and/or security considerations. Please note that you will not be asked to do any "live coding" as part of our interview process.
- *UX Considerations.* When developing interfaces, it’s important to consider how your users will interact with your application. We want to know what decisions you made when building the interface in this regard and what questions you’d ask of a product team to better improve the user experience.
- *Performance.* Applications we build need to perform well in order to not frustrate our users. We want to see how you think about improving users’ perceived performance as well as taking steps to improve measured performance.
- *Quality Assurance.* You do not need to provide multiple comprehensive test suites along with your code sample, but you should be prepared to talk about its testability from a number of perspectives, and in general how you would ensure its quality prior to deployment.
- *Deployment infrastructure and strategy.* One of the components of our interview process includes a discussion regarding the deployment of your solution. You will be asked to explain your (hypothetical) approach to deploying this client in a variety of scenarios with different constraints.
